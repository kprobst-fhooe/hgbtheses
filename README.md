## Thesis Checklist 

The following checklist includes common points to consider when creating your thesis:

### Content / Structure

- Is the problem clearly formulated? Is the work based on a clear research question?
- Is the goal of the work (“contribution”) clearly articulated? e.g. design guidelines / recommendations / considerations based on analysis and/or user study, prototype, design concepts…
- Is the current state of knowledge on the research subject (“related work”) taken into account?
  * up-to-date, representative references (preferably peer-reviewed formats such as scientific papers, journal articles, books)
  * for each reference, it should be clear how the present thesis differs from previous work and/or builds on it
- Is the methodological approach explained and justified?
  * what was done, why was it done, how was it done? (e.g., selection processes, design decisions...)
  * see also: user studies
- Are the results presented in a clear and structured way?
  * are figures used where appropriate? (e.g., to showcase solutions, to highlight results...)
  * are they critically reflected upon (“limitations”)?
  * see also: user studies
- Is there a clear takeaway (_“...So What?”_)?
  * are the results related to the initial research question and/or results from the related work (“common thread”)?
  * are there actionable design recommendations / design guidelines etc. for the readers of your thesis to learn from?

### User Studies

- Is the aim of the study clearly formulated? Are there clear hypotheses to be validated?
- Is the study design well done? e.g., sufficient number of participants, counterbalancing to avoid learning effects,...
- Is the study design described in a comprehensible manner?
  * Conditions (what is being evaluated?)
  * Participants (how many, their age / gender / prior experience...)
  * Measured quantitative and/or qualitative data (e.g., time, error, interview / questionnaire questions...)
  * Procedure (step-by-step explanation of the study routine)
- Reporting: Are the results presented in a clear and structured way? 
  * descriptive statistics: e.g., bar charts, box plots, tables... (don't forget about the indicate units or provide legends wherever appropriate!)
  * inferential statistics: e.g., ANOVA, t-test, correlation analysis... (statistical values by convention indicated in _italics_, e.g., _M_ = mean, _MD_ = median, _SD_ = standard deviation...)
  * qualitative data: e.g., number of participants exhibiting similar patterns / making similar statements, representative quotes... (don't forget do pseudonymize, e.g., "P1"!)
- Interpretation:
  * What do the results mean in relation to the initial research question / hypotheses?
  * What can we derive from this? What is the takeaway? see also: content / structure

### Form

- Is the thesis adequate in terms of spelling, grammar, sentence structure and writing style?
  * best to check while you are writing (e.g. Grammarly)
  * same naming for the same things / concepts: consistency
  * writing in German, use English terms wherever sensible (e.g. usability, tap, swipe, pinch)
  * writing in German, use gender according to [FHOÖ guidelines](https://fh-ooe.at/assets/files/diversity-inclusion/Handreichungen-Links/Sprachleitfaeden/FHO_21_Sprachleitfaden_Genderleitfaden_A4_210310lrn2.pdf)
  * abbreviations should be introduced when they are first mentioned in the text (e.g. “the Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) Scale states ..”), and can be used as such lateron in the text (best practice: do so at the beginning of each chapter, as it cannot be assumed that readers will read through your entire thesis)
- Is the thesis sensibly structured into chapters, subchapters, paragraphs?
  * not too short, not too long; rule of thumb: one “topic” per (sub)chapter, one “idea” per paragraph
  * approx. 5-8 chapters, approx. 3-5+ subchapters per chapter
- Is the length of the work adequate?
  * let's talk in words, just like any modern scientific conference does: Bachelor's thesis approx. 6000, Master's thesis approx. 9000
  * a reasonable proportion of figures is assumed (detailed figures / graphs may be part of the appendix)
- Are the headings descriptive and clear?
- Are tables / figures informative, titled, readable and their origins indicated?
  * each figure / table should be referenced in the text
  * figure / table caption should be clear, informative, concise (if copied from elsewhere, including reference, e.g. “adapted from [x]”, “based on [x]”)
  * font size inside figures / tables should be similar the body text
  * uniform formatting
- Is referencing done correctly?
  * immediately after naming authors and/or key content/concepts
  * list references just as they were part of a sentence (i.e., should come before the period at the end of the sentence)
  * multiple references to be combined into the same bracket (e.g., \cite{ref1, ref2}
  * for direct quotations including page number (e.g., \cite[p. 99]{ref3}
- Are references formatted correctly?
  * book references (@book) should include: date, author, title, publisher, ISBN
  * scientific paper references (@inproceedings) should include: date, author, title, booktitle, page / article number, DOI
  * journal article references (@article) should include: date, authos, title, journal, page / article number, DOI
  * web references (@online) should include: date, authors, title, url, urldate
- Are results that are too detailed for the main part of the work moved to the appendix? e.g. figures that would take up too much space in the main part or are not essential, details on the study design if too detailed for the main part (such as questions asked in interviews/questionnaires), results from studies that would be too detailed for the main part...
